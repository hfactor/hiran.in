The current focus is on writing more — whether it's on this website, or as random jotes in my journal (Thanks to [The Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bear_(tv_series))). I'm also embracing a hyperlocal lifestyle by exploring nearby stores, clubs, hotels, the library, and parks. GSoC Mentoring for [Circutverse](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/circuitverseorg) is happening. 

After the [Wayanad landslide](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/defaultinterstitial.cms) that claimed 400+ lives, I’m offering [design mentoring to support relief efforts](https://topmate.io/hiran/1125737), with all proceeds to [CMDRF](https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/). [Topmate](https://topmate.io/) has generously agreed to [match the donations](https://x.com/topmateHQ/status/1819727016062791847).
