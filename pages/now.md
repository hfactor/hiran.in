I am jotting down more notes in my notebook, experimenting with journaling styles for clarity and calmness. I will be focusing more on my working notes, and building more notes or outcomes from them. I am spending time with Claude, creating small, interesting web products.

After the [Wayanad landslide](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/defaultinterstitial.cms) that claimed 400+ lives, Iâ€™m offering [design mentoring to support relief efforts](https://topmate.io/hiran/1125737), with all proceeds to [CMDRF](https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/). [Topmate](https://topmate.io/) has generously agreed to [match the donations](https://x.com/topmateHQ/status/1819727016062791847).
