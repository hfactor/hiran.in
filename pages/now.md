Life's been busy with moving to a new place and starting a new job. My current focus is on writing more â€” whether it's on this website, in my newsletter, or through observational notes in my journal (Thanks to The Bear). I'm also embracing a hyperlocal lifestyle by exploring nearby stores, clubs, hotels, the library, and parks.  I'm also mentoring for [Circutverse](summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/circuitverseorg)'s GSoC.

Following the devastating [landslide in Wayanad](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/defaultinterstitial.cms) that claimed over 400 lives, I'm supporting relief efforts by offering [design mentoring for charity](https://topmate.io/hiran/1125737). All proceeds go to the [CMDRF](https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in/), and [Topmate](https://topmate.io/) has generously agreed to [match the donations](https://x.com/topmateHQ/status/1819727016062791847).
