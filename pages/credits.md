This domain is with since 2008, thanks to to <a href="https://twitter.com/anivar">Anivar Aravind</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. Over time, social media took centre stage, and while the site remained, it became mostly inactive. I once thought of using this domain as a design portfolio, but it never quite worked out. In 2020, I faced a crucial decision: either revitalise this project or let it go. That's when I discovered the concept of a digital garden, inspired by <a href="https://docs.thottingal.in/">Santosh Thottingal's Docs</a> and <a href="https://wiki.nikiv.dev/">Nikita Voloboev's Wiki.</a> This led me to the current version of Hiran.in!

This website is a reflection of my ongoing ideas and work, following a workflow that suits me best. The homepage design draws inspiration from <a href="https://paco.me/">Paco's website</a>, while the collections are based on <a href="https://matthewstrom.com/reading">Matthw Ström's</a> reading list. The Async design coaching is inspired by <a href="https://anthonyhobday.com/">Anthony Hobday</a>, and the Now page is based on <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers's</a> <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now Page</a>.
