I occasionally mentor founders, designers, and early-stage startups. Having built products from scratch and scaled design teams, I enjoy sharing insights about design foundations, processes, and team buildingâ€”especially during the crucial 0-1 and 1-10 phases.

I provide design feedback for products, run focused workshops for teams, and offer career guidance through platforms like ADPList and Topmate. <s>For products requiring ongoing design direction, I offer monthly asynchronous feedback sessions at $300/month via Figma or email.</s>
