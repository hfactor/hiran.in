1. [[Meetings are not the place to surprise people]]
2. Meeting should have an agenda, in-fact, meeting invite should come with an agenda.
3. Not everyone has to speak, but everyone has to feel heard.
4. Time-box meetings to 15, 30 or 45 mins. If possible to 14, 27 or 42 mins!
5. [[You don't have to be the first with an opinion]]
6. These days, I am aligned to the idea of recording meetings by default for async consumption
7. Have no-meeting days if you can!
8. [[Documenting Meetings]]
9. [[Decision Documentation for Communication]]
