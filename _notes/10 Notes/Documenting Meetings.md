A good meeting note focuses on distillation of information. It should keep things concise without loosing important information. The purpose of meeting note is not to time track. (Use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/track/), or alternatives for that.)

Meeting notes, (if not generated from transcript) usually contains information of similar kind. Majority will be questions, answers, decisions and action to take-care. I use those phrases as hashtags in my notes. This makes it easier to read, track and  search. While next actions are captured, I don't go back and update the meeting notes. 

I prefer using [Obsidian Periodic Notes ](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) or Logseq's Daily page for dumping daily notes, instead of one-note-per-meeting. 

### File Example : 
```
File : 10-Feb-2023.md

- 11:00, Meeting on [[Project A]]
	- #Info We are not building that feature in this sprint #PersonA
	- #TODO Update the figma, remove the feature #Done
	- #Question Are we updating the documentation?, to #PersonB
	- #TIL, the date we shared with client is Q3, not Q2
- 13:00, [[1:1 with Person A]]
	- #TODO Prepare next year hiring count and budget
	- #Question Ask #PersonC, if we are hiring remote or to WFO
	- #Idea, add a survey along with [[Project A]]
```
