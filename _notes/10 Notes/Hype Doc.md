# The Hype Doc: Capturing Achievements and Growth

Despite [[Documenting Meetings]], creating a [[Design Decision Log]], [[Save Screenshots]], and having a clear [[How I use Bullet Journal]] method, I often draw a blank during yearly reviews. The Hype Doc solves this issue. It's an ever-growing note on small wins, accomplishments, and aspirations.

The Hype Doc can include your learnings, skill improvements, direct and indirect projects you worked or collaborated, your teams achievements, compliments on your team members, events, screenshots. Just keep collecting it. [[Save Screenshots]]. 

I currently maintain two Hype Docs: One for Office - A simple spreadsheet with three columns - Date, What, and Link and a personal markdown file in Obsidian with a dated bullet list. It's rough, unedited, and private.
