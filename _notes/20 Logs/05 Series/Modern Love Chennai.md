An anthology like Modern Love, set in Chennai, comprises captivating stories. 

The first segment, *Lalagunda Bommaigal* by Raju Murugan, showcases his storytelling flair. Sean Roldan's song *Pandaya Pura* and Prasanna Ram Kumar's role add intrigue.

*Imaigal* by Balaji Sakthivel (known for classics like *Kaadhal* and *Vazhakku Enn 18/9*) stars Bhanu and Ashok Selvan. It's a heartwarming tale about relationship challenges arising from unforeseen medical conditions.

*Kaadhal Enbadhu Kannula Heart Irukkura Emoji*, directed by Krishnakumar Ramakumar, follows Mallika, whose ideas of love are shaped by cinema. The film's creation exudes charm – as do the egg puffs!

*Margazhi* tells the story of a girl finding solace in Ilaiyaraaja's music during a difficult phase. Enhanced by beautiful writing and Ilaiyaraaja's compositions, *Nenjil Oru Minnal* stands out as a must-listen.

Bharathiraja, renowned for relationship-focused films, presents *Paravai Kootil Vaazhum Maangal* – a mature tale about a married man, his wife, and his new love interest. Excellently paced and acted, it delivers what you'd expect from this theme.

*Ninaivo Oru Paravai* exemplifies Thiagarajan Kumararaja's complex storytelling. Wamiqa Gabbi shines in her role within Thaiga's intricate world.

The series' crowning glory is its stellar music album featuring Ilaiyaraaja, Yuvan, G V Prakash, and Sean Roldan – a treat worth repeating!
