Decoupled, a mainstream Indian series, can be described as a black comedy and a master class in sarcasm. Each sentence is crafted for maximum sarcastic impact, and various categorys are intentionally included to showcase the writer's perspective. This is unsurprising, given that the writer is Manu Joseph, one of India's most sarcastic writers.

This series is all about dialogue and conversation. It tackles categorys often avoided due to political correctness or reasoning, using them as fodder for sarcasm.  Decoupled may not be universally liked, as it has its own grey areas where some viewers may be unsure of their overall opinion.
