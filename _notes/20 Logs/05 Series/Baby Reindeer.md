Baby Reindeer is an unsettling masterpiece that blurs the lines between autobiography and drama. Raw portrayal of stalking, trauma, and obsession, Richard Gadd's semi-autobiographical series demands emotional investment while making you question the reliability of memory and perspective. (Trigger warning: contains explicit depictions of stalking, sexual assault, emotional abuse, and substance use.)

The performances are haunting, particularly Jessica Gunning as Martha, who brings such complexity to what could have been a one-dimensional antagonist. She makes you oscillate between empathy and horror, often within the same scene. 

What sets Baby Reindeer apart is its unflinching examination of masculinity and vulnerability. The claustrophobic cinematography and anxiety-inducing sound design create an atmosphere that lingers long after viewing.
