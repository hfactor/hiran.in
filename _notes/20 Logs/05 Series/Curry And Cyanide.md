I am uncertain if I like the series due to the excessive drama and unexpected portrayal of certain visuals. But the storytelling has a genuine soul. The story unfolds as it did in real life which adds authenticity to the narration. 

The mature production and clean cinematography deserve applause. However, some parts could have been edited or trimmed.  One interviewee, a psychologist, had contradictory statements that could have been avoided to create a shorter series.
