*The Bear* is a true mind-bender. With its complex narrative, flawed yet sophisticated characters, and editing that demands full attention, it's definitely worth binge-watching, though it can be tough to consume in one sitting. The performances are stellar, and the characters are not only well-written but also strategically placed. The pace shifts from episode to episode, making it difficult to find a consistent rhythm in the storytelling. However, the beautiful montages and striking color usage across the visuals make it one of the finest series out there.

I started watching it based on [Anand's](https://x.com/uxfish) recommendation, without knowing much beforehand. I initially thought it would focus on food and the restaurant business, but the way the show uses those elements as a backdrop while delving into the psychological aspects was stunning. (Trigger warning: themes of suicide, dysfunctional family dynamics, and workplace mistreatment.)

Though not the main characters, a special mention goes to Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Richie and Jamie Lee Curtis as Donna. Their character arcs are sophisticated and stereotypical, and the way they perform truly conveys the depth of emotion.

PS: I want to rewatch it, but I won't.
