The Hunt for Veerappan is an outstanding true crime docu-series with exceptional storytelling, providing in-depth details about Veerappan. As someone from South India, born after the Veerappan situation, I was only aware of him as a smuggler and poacher, and the Raj Kumar incident. This series revealed many unknown aspects, such as his brutality, the police's actions towards his people and villagers, and the overall grey area.

The series is an unbiased information bomb, shedding light on both sides of the story. Instead of focusing solely on Veerappan's cruelty, it delves into the reasons behind certain events, how the government and people responded, and his issues with the police. This excellent series is worth binge-watching, as I did.
