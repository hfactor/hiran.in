Maverick and Farmer is a roaster (and cafe) from Bangalore. 
### Say Hello to Mellow ✦
Mild roasted Arabic from Maverick & Farmers is my favourites of all. (In a way, this is my default go-to coffee these days). It has great mouth feel, provides a great clean cup of coffee, and the flavour notes is bit fruity (Banana, as they claim).

### Tall Dark Handsome ✦
Another favourite, a decent dark roast. It's 100% single estate arabica, and has a mild-smoky flavour. [Store Link](https://www.maverickandfarmer.com/collections/coffees/products/tall-dark-handsome)

### Rohan Bopanna's Masterblend
An interesting experiment from Maverick & Farmers - it's a blend of arabica form same estate, but processed in two different ways - Washed, Honey processed. It stays clean, and has a body texture, and comes with a mild-sweetness. [Store Link](https://www.maverickandfarmer.com/collections/coffees/products/rohan-bopannas-masterblend-1)
