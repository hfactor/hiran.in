I have tried making Coffee using South Indian Coffee Powder (Robusta+Chicory, Generally 4:1 ratio) and it's worth mentioning. It's similar to [[Recipe - V60-style with AeroPress]], with reduced the temperature (which reduces the bitterness) and increased the water (diluting it). 


- AeroPress Position: Standard 
- Filter : 2 Papers, Rinse filter if it's new. 
- Brewing Time: 1:30
- Target Coffee : 180ml

- Add 13 grams of South Indian Coffee Powder.
- Add 60ml of 80c water, let it bloom for 30 seconds
- Add another 150ml of water and place the plunger
- Wait for 30 seconds
- Press for 20-30 seconds, and stop **before** the hiss.
