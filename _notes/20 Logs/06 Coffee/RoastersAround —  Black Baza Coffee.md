### Jumping Ant ✦
SLN9 Arabica's washed and light roasted. This is one of the finest light roast available in town, and has Orange and Tea notes. Sweet and Acidic. Works well with every brewing method.  [Store Link](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/jumping-ant)

### Loris ✦
Loris is the Jumping Ant, but dark roasted. It's SLN9 Dark roasted, providing a high bodied chocolate notes, with sweetness and bitterness. My pick of Dark Roasted for [[Aeropress]]. [Store Link](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/loris)

### Luna 
If you are looking for a dark roast that works with milk and sugar, Luna is the answer. It's Robusta from Waynad (Kent), dark roasted with high body, sweetness and bitterness. It has spice notes (I didn't find the chocolate or tobacco notes as mentioned by makers) and is best for South Indian Filter Coffee Brewing.

### Wanderoo
Wanderoo is a safe bet if you are starting a coffee shop. It works with every brewing method, provides defined flavours, is sweet and acidic. This SLN9 Medium Roast has a creamy, nutty (Almond they claim), sweet chocolate flavour notes. I think it goes well with milk too, never tried.

### Galaxy Frog
Galaxy Frog is a blend, mix of Wanderoo and Frogmouth (Arabicas from the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu) and is sweeter than Wanderoo. Buy if you want to experiment.*(PS: I love how they name things, and I bought this just coz of that!)* [Store Link](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/galaxy-frog)

### Ficus
A blend of washed Arabica and natural, sun-dried Robusta grown under the shade of Ficus trees. It has berry notes, is bitter and not at all acidic. One of the first roasts I tried from Black Baza. [Store Link](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/ficus)

### Otter
Mix of SLN9 and Kent (BR Hills, Karnataka + Wayanad, Kerala), Otter is a good cup of coffee if you are looking for a sweet yet bitter, coffee with less acidity and full of body. Goes well with Aero press. [Store Link](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/otter)

### Microlot 36 | Anaerobic Fermentation of Washed Arabica
This is the first [Microlot](https://www.drivencoffee.com/blog/what-is-microlot-coffee/) I tried, and I loved the flavor. It's washed Arabica SLN9, anaerobically fermented a local farm. It is light medium roast with a fruity, sweet acidic and great aroma. [Store Link](https://store.blackbazacoffee.com/products/microlot-anaerobic-fermentation-of-washed-arabica)

### Whistling Schoolboy
I tried [[AeroPress with South Indian Coffee Powder]] with Black Baza's "South Indian" Blend. This is Ficus/Otter + 20% Chicory. It might go great with milk, as it has a natural sweetness, I didn't find the chicory as aromatic as traditional south India coffee powders.
