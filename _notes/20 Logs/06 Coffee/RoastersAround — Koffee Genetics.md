I’m still unsure whether it’s Genetics Coffee or Koffee Genetics, as both names are used. Regardless, they excel in what they do and are among the finest roasters.
### SL-28 CM Washed✦
This is my current favorite. It undergoes Carbonic Maceration fermentation and is roasted to a medium level, resulting in a stunning coffee with notes of orange, grapefruit, and a nutty taste. It’s excellent for a [[V60-style Aeropress Recipe for Medium Dark Roast]] or a standard pour-over coffee.
### Jack Sparrow
It's rum-barrel-aged coffee beans that smell fresh with hints of spicy rum. Once brewed, the aroma is sweet, reminiscent of Captain Morgan Original Spiced with a smoky wood scent, but it lacks coffee notes. It could be a great drink, but it's not quite coffee!
