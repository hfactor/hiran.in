Marc's operates from Auroville, and they are into training as well. They have amazing coffees, tho a bit different from rest - especially in roasting. An opinionated coffee brand, I would say!

### Julien Peak Forest✦
Arabica from Shevaroy Hills, Tamil Nadu, roasted to light (Medium Light for me), the coffee comes is acidic and has less body. The flavour sweet notes are of cinnamon. The aroma is fresh and floral and great for morning cup of coffee.
### Skia Blend
A robusta-arabic mix, with hazelnut and brownie flavours. The flavour was nice, but looks like it's a better if paired with milk. Not my cup.
