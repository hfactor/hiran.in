I had an opportunity to taste Coffee from Handcrafted cafe, Bhopal and I loved what they are serving. I recently started buying beans from them, and the delivery and quality of what they delivered was good. 
### Liquid Luck✦
A blend roast, with good fruit notes. It's great for [[V60-style Aeropress Recipe for Medium Dark Roast]]. 

### Stanmore Estate
Mixed Arabica, roasted to medium, with a honey and nutty notes. I am yet to experiment with it, but is a great roast for black coffee.
