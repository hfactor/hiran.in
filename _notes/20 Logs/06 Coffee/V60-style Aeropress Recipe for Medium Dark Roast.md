Based on [v60 style](https://aeroprecipe.com/recipes/v60-style-aeropress-dark), re-calculated for AeroPress Go (the max capacity is 245ml). I prefer Dark Roast or Medium Dark Roast for this recipe. 

- AeroPress Position: Standard 
- Filter : 2 Papers, Rinse filter if it's new. 
- Brewing Time: 1:30
- Target Coffee : 120ml

- Add 13 grams of Medium Grid Coffee Powder
- Add 50ml of 85-88c water, let it bloom for 30 seconds
- Add another 100ml of water and place the plunger
- Wait for 30 seconds
- Press for 20-30 seconds, and stop before the hiss. 
- (Press after hiss, if you want the oil, in that case, press faster!)
