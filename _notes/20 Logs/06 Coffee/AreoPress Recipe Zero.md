This recipe is designed for the AeroPress Go, perfect for travel without a thermometer or scale. It's optimised for medium roast, medium-fine ground coffee.

## Preparation
- Boil water, but not to 100Â°C.
- Rinse the plunger, chamber, and filter cap (with 2 paper filters) using hot water. Rinsing maintains temperature and enhances taste. I usually rinse the plunger and chamber first, and then paper and filter cap with same water. 
- Set up AeroPress in inverted position, aligning plunger to the 'registered' mark.
## Brewing
- Add one level AeroPress spoon of coffee grounds.
- Pour a small amount of water to wet grounds and bloom.
- Stir 2 times left-right and top-down with the provided stirrer.
- Slowly fill the chamber with remaining water.
- Carefully attach and lock the filter cap. Invert AeroPress onto your cup and press until you hear a hiss.
- Clean your AeroPress while coffee settles for a minute.
- Serve as is, or customise with hot water or ice.
