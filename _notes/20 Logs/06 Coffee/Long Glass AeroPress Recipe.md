This is my default daily recipe. I follow this recipe to make a tall glass of coffee (or split-to-two). For this I prefer medium-dark, or dark roast. 

- AeroPress Position : Inverted
- Filter: 1 Paper, Rinse filter if it's new. 
- Good to pre-heat AeroPress with a quick rinse.
- Brewing Time : 2:30, Target Coffee : 300ml

- Add 16 grams of Medium Grid Coffee Powder
- Add 30ml of 85-88c water, let it bloom for 30 seconds
- Add 150ml water
- Wait for 90 seconds
- Press gently, target 30 seconds (2:00-2:30)
- Add 180ml of 85-88c water.
