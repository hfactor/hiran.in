Moka is a great tool to make rich, concentrated brew, especially if you like cloudy texture. It's easy, and by following very basic steps, it guarantee a good coffee. I prefer medium-dark or dark coffee for this method. 

- Coffee : 20gm
- Grind : Fine
- Water : 140ml 
- Brewing Time: 2:30
- Target Coffee : 100ml+

## Steps

-  Clean and dry moka pot parts
-  **Fill the bottom part with hot water to valve**
-  Add grounds to basket (level it, don't tamp)
-  Clean rim, assemble pot
-  Set heat to medium-low
-  Watch for first coffee drops
-  **Reduce temperature to lowest**  
- Remove when stream turns blonde
- **Cool bottom with wet towel**
- Serve immediately
