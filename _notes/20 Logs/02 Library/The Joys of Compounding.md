Gautam Baid's approach to investing and life principles offers a fascinating blend of financial wisdom and personal development. What caught my attention was how he connects the concept of compounding not just to financial growth, but to learning, habits, and relationships. 

The book stands out for its holistic view of success, emphasising how mental models and disciplined habits compound over time to create extraordinary results. Read it for clear explanations and real-world examples, even if you are clear about the context.
