A very deep, interesting, perspective-changing book on how we think and make decisions. The concept of System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, analytical) thinking helped me recognise patterns in my own decision-making that I had never noticed before. He explains cognitive biases through simple experiments and examples that made me catch myself making the same mistakes he describes.

The book is dense with insights, but real-world examples make complex psychological concepts surprisingly accessible. It's one of those books that continues to influence how I think long after reading it.
