I grew up watching Mani Ratnam's films, with *Kannathil Muthamittaal* being my first serious movie experience and the first non-masala Tamil film I saw in theaters. It opened the door to classics like *Thalapathi*, *Iruvar*, and made me realize the same director was behind *Alaipayuthey* and *Nayakan*.

The book is a series of in-depth conversations presented in an interview format, but beautifully categorized by each movie. Every general question is tied to a specific film, with Mani Ratnam using that film as an example to answer, drawing you deeper into both the conversation and the movies themselves.

This format encouraged me to watch or rewatch each film after reading its corresponding chapter. It took me about 40 days to complete the cycle of reading, watching, and rereading, making it one of my longest active reading experiences! I now wish I had taken notes while watching—maybe it’s time for a daily dose of Mani Ratnam all over again!
