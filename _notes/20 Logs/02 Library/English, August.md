It's hard to believe that this novel was written in 1988. The protagonist's inner dialogues and the sarcastic tone used to discuss various subjects reveal that, despite differences in age, background, and experiences, there is a shared way of thinking among people.

The novel's exploration of women, literature, and societal mockery is refreshingly unexpected for an Indian novel of that period. It delves into cultural clashes, such as those between rich and poor or contrasting cities, hierarchies and government workings. The protagonist's sarcasm is relatable to anyone in their 20s â€“ judging and criticizing others internally, disinterested in repetitive stories, lying out of boredom, or fabricating tales for amusement.

Regrettably, a film adaptation of this novel has been lost over time. It's disheartening that we can no longer enjoy the movie featuring talents like K.U. Mohan on cinematography and Rahul Bose in the lead role as Agastya Sen/August. There are rumors of a recovered copy undergoing restoration; let's hope for the best.
