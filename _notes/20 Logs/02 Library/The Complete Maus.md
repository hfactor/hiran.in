Maus is a powerful example of how art can deeply connect with human emotions. It doesn’t just tell the story of the Holocaust—it makes you feel its pain. The use of animal characters and black-and-white drawings might give it the appearance of a "cartoon," but the depth and honest portrayal of trauma, the father-son relationship, and the horrors of the Holocaust create an unforgettable experience.

What sets Maus apart is its brilliant use of animals to represent different ethnicities and nationalities, an allegory that adds depth while still resonating with the reader. It offers insight into how ethnicity and nationalism operate. 

The book is a slow, deliberate read, and its haunting black-and-white artwork will linger with you long after.
