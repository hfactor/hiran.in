"The Twelve Monotasks" argues against the habit of multitasking. The book tackles one simple thing - focusing on a single task works better than juggling many. Each chapter looks at common activities like eating, reading, and talking, showing how giving full attention makes these experiences better.

The book keeps things practical with clear steps for monotasking in daily life. No complex theories or jargon - just useful ways to break free from the multitasking trap and get more from what we do.
