I picked up this productivity book at an airport to pass time. It serves well as an introduction to productivity concepts, particularly for newcomers or those returning to the genre after a break. The author has structured the information methodically, presenting ideas in a clear, organised manner. 

While many concepts were familiar, they were presented directly without unnecessary padding. The book balances psychological insights with practical solutions. It's a serviceable guide that accomplishes what it sets out to do.
