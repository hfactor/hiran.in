A highly detailed book by one of India’s finest ad makers, offering a blend of personal experiences and professional insights into the evolution of the Indian advertising industry. It's not a pack of information, hence a page-turner everyone who remembers Fevicol and Fevikwik ads :) 

The book highlights his creativity, the process behind successful campaigns, and how limitations like budget constraints can act as catalysts for innovation. What makes Piyush's ads resonate is their simplicity and emotional connection, and the book mirrors that approach—no grand claims or overly complicated narratives. If you're a '90s kid from India, you’ll likely spend hours revisiting old ads and indulging in nostalgia!
