I picked up this book after watching countless Ali Abdaal videos on YouTube, and it delivered what I expected. If you've watched his content, you'll find the same principles unfold on paper.

The book stands as an anti-thesis to hustle culture, which I found both refreshing and repetitive. Ali keeps circling back to his core message: it's okay to enjoy your work, take breaks without guilt, and find pleasure in being productive. 

This is the kind of book you can easily read in chunks or skim through when needed. It's a decent read if you're looking to break free from guilt-driven productivity and want something that thoughtfully challenges hustle culture.
