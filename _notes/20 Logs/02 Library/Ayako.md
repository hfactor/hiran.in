As someone new to manga, I picked up Ayako after hearing about it, especially since it was available at a fraction of its usual price. Now, I regret not diving into manga sooner!

Originally written in 1972 as a manga series, Ayako captivated me with its post-WW2 Japanese setting and its historical-fiction narrative. What truly sets it apart is the complexity in its storytelling, characters, and heavy themes like dysfunctional families, incest, and abuse. The artwork is brilliant, not just conveying the plot, but also highlighting the tension, drama, and psychological depth throughout.

Iâ€™m aware that the story is rich with symbolism and layered meanings, though many of them went over my head due to my lack of manga knowledge and cultural context!
