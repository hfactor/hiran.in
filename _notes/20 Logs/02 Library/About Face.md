Fundaments of interaction design packed into a book, a must read for Developers and Designers. Book dive deep into why humans interact with technology the way they do. What really clicked for me was their concept of goal-directed design and how they emphasise understanding user behaviours over just collecting feature requests.

While some technical sections can be dense, their real-world examples and clear explanations helped make complex concepts digestible.
