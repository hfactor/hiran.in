Arron Walter's approach to product design feels human-centered in a world often dominated by metrics and features. The book resonated with me because it emphasizes the importance of emotional design and user psychology alongside the technical aspects of product development. His insights about creating products that not only work well but also forge emotional connections with users changed how I think about design decisions.
