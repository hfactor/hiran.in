A collection of essays about Sanjay Leela Bhansali's films which examine his aesthetics and world-building. While the writing was engaging, I haven't watched any of his films recently, so the book served mainly as a surface-level overview. 

Unlike [[Conversations with Mani Ratnam]]which inspired me to revisit his films, this book didn't evoke strong memories or motivate me to rewatch Bhansali's work. The book would appeal to dedicated fans of his cinema.
