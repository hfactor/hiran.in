If you want to learn OKRs, this books is for you. Writer has skills to convert a management framework to readable content with a flawless, storytelling. Instead of just explaining the mechanics, she weaves the concepts into a realistic situation, focusing on both the challenges and benefits. I wish the book was a bit smaller as some parts are over-explained. The templates and examples she provides for setting and tracking OKRs is a plus.
