I am struggling with attention management, and his book is a deep dive into the problem. As I am struggling with constant distractions and information overload, this book provided a hope that things can be sorted. His suggestions are obvious, and idea is hard to adapt to practical life (me problem, not authors!) his writing style keeps complex concepts about cognitive science accessible and immediately applicable.

Did I read. Yes. Am I following his suggestions, no yet!
