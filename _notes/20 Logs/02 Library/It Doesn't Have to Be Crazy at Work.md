The entire thesis presented in this book feels like a breath of fresh air in today's hustle-obsessed work culture. Instead of celebrating burnout, Fried and Hansson provide a clear roadmap for building a sustainable work environment. What really clicked for me was their blueprint of what great management looks like - even if it feels like an unattainable dream in many workplaces. **If you can't find this kind of manager, become one yourself as you grow in your career!**

I particularly appreciated their counterintuitive takes on common business practices, like their stance against unnecessary meetings and artificial deadlines. The book's short, focused chapters make it easy to digest and implement these ideas. 
While some might dismiss their approach as unrealistic, their success with Basecamp proves that calm, sustainable work isn't just a nice theory - it's a viable way to build a successful business.
