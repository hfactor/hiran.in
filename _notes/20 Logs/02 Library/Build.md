Tony Fadell's "Build" gave me a rare glimpse into the mind of someone who helped create products I use every day. As the inventor of the iPod and founder of Nest, Fadell shares his experiences in a way that made me feel like I was getting mentored by a tech industry veteran. What really stuck with me was his emphasis on the messy reality of creating something new - it's not about having perfect ideas, but about the willingness to keep refining and pushing through failures.

The book shines when Fadell shares specific stories about product development, from the early iPod days to building Nest. His advice about focusing on the user's experience rather than just the technology really changed how I think about products. While some parts get a bit technical, his straightforward writing style and real-world examples kept me engaged throughout.
