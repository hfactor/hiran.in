Reading "Remote" feels almost prophetic now, as Fried and Hansson laid out the blueprint for successful remote work years before it became widespread. Their practical insights about trust, communication, and productivity in remote teams resonated deeply with my own experiences. What struck me most was their emphasis on asynchronous work and how it can lead to better, more thoughtful collaboration.

The book challenges common misconceptions about remote work while providing actionable solutions to real challenges. Their focus on results over hours worked and their tips for maintaining work-life boundaries in a remote setting feel especially relevant.
