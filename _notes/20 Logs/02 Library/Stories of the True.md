English translations of Jeymohan's stories, including "A Hundred Arm Chair" and "Elephant Doctor". The translations preserve the emotional resonance of the original works remarkably well. 

Jeymohan's storytelling strength lies in his intimate portrayal of Dalit life in India. His narratives delve beyond surface-level observations, exploring deep-seated emotional and cultural complexities. His characters emerge as fully realised individuals rather than mere representations of their social status.
