"Super Thinking" is a crash course in mental model. It does a fantastic job of collecting and explaining the most useful mental models from various fields - psychology, economics, physics, and more.  It's not just a collection, but a well organised book that shows how to actually use them in daily decision-making. Some sections can feel dense with information.
