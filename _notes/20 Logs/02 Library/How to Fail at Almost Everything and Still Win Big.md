Scott Adams' book hit me differently than most self-help books I've read. Instead of giving the usual "follow your passion" advice, he shares his personal story of failing repeatedly - at everything from corporate jobs to restaurants to video games - before creating Dilbert. 

His honest approach about treating success as a system rather than a goal. He convinced that being good at a combination of skills is more practical than being excellent at just one thing. The most eye-opening part for me was his take on goals vs. systems. While everyone talks about setting goals, Adams suggests that goals are for losers and systems are for winners. 

His casual, humorous writing style made complex ideas feel simple and actionable, though some might find his confidence a bit too strong at times. (He can be, he made Dilbert!)
