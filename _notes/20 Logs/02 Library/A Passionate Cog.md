A Passionate Cog stands as an unsubtle critique of contemporary Indian politics. Through parallel universe storytelling, Krityam takes aim at India's right-wing movements. The illustrations carry sharp wit, and the satirical world-building echoes the biting commentary of V.K.N and other Indian political writers.

The work stumbles in its execution. The dialogue lacks natural flow, defaulting to explanatory passages that read like political documentation. Characters speak in overly descriptive terms, transforming conversations into something akin to a FAQ section. What could have been a significant piece of political satire loses its edge due to excessive exposition and redundant explanations. A more focused editing approach, with reduced text and sharper dialogue, might have elevated this work to classic status.
