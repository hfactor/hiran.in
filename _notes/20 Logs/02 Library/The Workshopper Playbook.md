It's a book for niche. It provides clarity to his [[4C Workshop Framework]], a method and framework collaborative sessions. It's detailed, clear, structured - and is told more like a timed instruction manual for us to follow. His expertise in managing people of different energy level, hierarchical power, and ego is clear from his approach. It's a good framework, and a great foundation.
