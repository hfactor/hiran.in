I’m a fan of Krish Ashok’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/krishashok), where his storytelling, science, and passion for food come together in a unique way. His narrative style makes you feel like part of the process, and it enhances your experience the next time you enjoy that dish.

Masala Labs feels like a book version of his YouTube videos, but more organised and focused specifically on Indian cooking. The book aims to break down Indian culinary practices through scientific principles, offering a helpful framework for those who find Indian cooking sophisticated by explaining what does what.

At times, the book can feel like information overload, especially if you're not into the detailed chemistry and just want the overall concept. But that’s the beauty of a book—you can always skip a section, and the author knows how to pull you back in!
