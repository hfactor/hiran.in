Kleon talks about the everyday struggle of showing up and doing the *work*. His advice about creating a daily routine and treating your work like a regular practice rather than waiting for inspiration and the importance of taking care of yourself while maintaining a creative life really resonated with me. 

His suggestions about going analog, making lists, and taking regular walks aren't revolutionary, but the way he presents them - with simple illustrations and examples - makes them feel both doable and essential. 

The book itself feels like a friendly conversation with someone who understands the ups and downs of creative life.
