A worthwhile read, this book offers a comprehensive and structured insight into Basecamp's problem-solving and product-building approach, gathered from various tweets and blogs.

Learn to focus on shaping the problem by defining it and setting boundaries before diving into its construction. In other words, bet on the race, not the horse, as Basecamp would say!

Numerous concepts from this book, such as [[Breadboarding over Wireframes]], [[Decide when to stop]], [[Design early to fail faster]], [[Look for rabbit holes]], [[Work is like a hill]] and [[Is this a real problem]] can be applied to various development processes. For instance, I've been using [[Breadboarding]] and the [[Stop spending time on Wireframing]] since 2018/2019 in Agile, Scrum, and Kanban projects.
