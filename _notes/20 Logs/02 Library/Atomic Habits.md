A refreshingly practical, logical approach on habit formation. The crux of his thesis is to focus on small, tiny daily routines, instead of focusing on massive changes. Some of the concepts might seem obvious in hindsight, the way he combines science with daily applications makes this book stand out from other habit-forming guides. Every era has it's own 'self-help' book, and Atomic Habits is the self-help *that* period.
