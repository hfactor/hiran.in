The book started off strong, with engaging introductions, great examples, and insightful definitions of Indian movie songs and their patterns. It was captivating and a real page-turner. However, it eventually shifted into an overload of information—focusing on people and their contributions—becoming more like a Wikipedia entry. 

While that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as it serves as a great resource for specific information, I gradually realised it’s not intended to be a page-turner.
