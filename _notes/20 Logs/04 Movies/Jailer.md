Jailer, Nelson's response to his own film Beast, deviates from the typical Rajni movie formula while still providing a unique experience. In this film, Rajni portrays his actual age, forgoing romance and clear flashbacks, embracing a bloodier narrative, and featuring an ensemble of Indian stars in guest appearances.

The fascinating concept of Rajni "doing" without actually doing could have failed, as evidenced by his hesitation to remake the Malayalam classic New Delhi in Tamil. However, Jailer successfully utilizes Rajni's aura and crafts an emotional drama around the anticipated content of his films.

In my opinion, Shiva Rajkumar's cameo outshines Mohanlal's cameo, and Remya Krishnan's role could have been more substantial than mere support.
