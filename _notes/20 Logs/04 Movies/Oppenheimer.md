Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable, skilfully encapsulating the internal conflict and moral turmoil that shaped the scientist's compelling journey.  With Christopher Nolan's classic non-linear storytelling, the audience gets a comprehensive view of Oppenheimer's life.

The cinematography is truly breathtaking, complemented by Hans Zimmer's haunting and potent score. Together, they create a sensory experience that enhances the film's emotional depth. Oppenheimer serves as a reminder of cinema's ability to delve into the intricacies of human nature and the profound choices we confront in the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
