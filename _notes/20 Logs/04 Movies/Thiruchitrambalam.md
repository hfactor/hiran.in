There exist two varieties of Dhanush films: one where he embodies the typical Tamil movie hero, and another where he adopts a more relatable persona. This film falls into the latter category.

The movie itself is straightforward, the brilliance lies in the clarity and finesse of its execution. Nithya Menon, Bharathiraja, and Prakash Raj charmingly fulfill their roles, while Raashii Khanna meets her character's demands precisely - good looking and disconnected. Anirudh's musical contributions significantly enhance the film, particularly with the tracks "*Thenmozhi*" and "*Megham Karukatha*".
