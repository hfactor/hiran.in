 > VJS is attached to his character but is also detached from the plot. He stands slightly at a distance from what is happening around him, to maintain a dry and sarcastic commentary.

The storytelling and screenplay are what make this movie a fine piece of work. The story, like VJS, is connected and empathetic to the characters but detached from the plot. What we get is a comedy of errors. But are they comedy or errors? That's what strikes a chord.

Natarajan Subramaniam showcases his talent with conviction, as he did in the classic "Sathuranga Vettai." It's good to see him in a role that matches his talent after a long time.

However, the movie is not perfect, partly due to Mamta Mohandas and Anurag Kashyap. The writer failed to create a solid base character for Mamta, and Anurag Kashyap was a poor casting choice, serving as a walking essay on bad acting.
