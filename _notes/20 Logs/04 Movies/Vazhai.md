hai stands out in Tamil cinema for how it tells both personal stories and tackles social issues. The plantation setting becomes a microcosm of larger societal power structures, with the vertical hierarchy of the banana plants themselves serving as a powerful visual metaphor for social stratification.

Mari Selvaraj's masterful control over narrative in Vazhai is evident in how he weaves together multiple perspectives that operate on different emotional frequencies. The children's storyline moves with an immediate, almost slice-of-life rhythm - consumed by the pressing concerns of weekend job, homework, and school life. In striking contrast, the adult narrative threads carry a heavier temporal burden, focused on the grinding reality that daily survival doesn't translate to long-term progress. And they coexist without forcing artificial intersections. 

The film's structure is particularly clever in how it grows and shrinks like a breathing thing. Instead of just building up to one big problem, the story moves like waves - it starts with showing how one family lives, expands to show bigger social issues, then narrows down to needs like hunger, before opening up again to reveal how the whole system is broken. 

The music especially adds an unexpected layer, suggesting that even in tough times, people's spirit of resistance and joy can't be crushed.
