The movie has several issues, including subpar art, weak VFX, miscast actors, and an awkward flow of song-murder-song scenes. The biggest problem, however, is the length. At 179 minutes, the film feels unnecessarily dragged out, and would have benefited from tighter editing to bring it down to a manageable 150 minutes. (Maanadu was a crisp 147 minutes and packed with entertainment.) *A 20% cut would have made this film 80% better.*

On the casting front, the female characters were poorly written. While it was nice to see Sneha back on screen, Meenakshi Chaudhary was a disappointing choice.
