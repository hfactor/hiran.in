I didn't grow up immersed in The Archies; it was something I encountered occasionally. Hence this adaptation, the characters and plot didn't evoke any significant nostalgia for me. The storytelling was tidy, and the story was quite straightforward - an ideal "no crime, no harm, all is well" film for the holidays. Zoya has a knack for portraying high society convincingly, as evident in her previous movies, and she does so here as well. However, this wasn't quite what I expected from Zoya; the Zoya factor seems to be missing this time around. Also absent is Reema Kagti's assistance in co-writing the script.

Agastya Nanda has a pleasing appearance, but his acting is more of Abhishek Bachchan's (whom I appreciate in some films). Suhana Khan exudes the charm and confidence we see with SRK, while Khushi Kapoor is a letdown.

For fans of The Archies, witnessing an Indian adaptation might be enjoyable or even exceptional. However, for a Zoya fan, this movie serves merely as a time-killer.
