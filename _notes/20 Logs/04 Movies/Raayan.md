Dhanush's 50th movie as an actor and his second directorial venture is a clean film that demonstrates his clarity on what he wants to contribute to Tamil cinema. While the second half of the story lacks depth and follows a formulaic approach to relationships, trust, and betrayal, the movie remains engaging due to his precise casting choices. Each cast and crew member significantly elevates the film.

The movie is rooted and reminiscent of Dhanush's previous works like *Polladhavan*, *Aadukalam*, and *Vada Chennai*. The setting and story are raw and bloody, yet it contains less violence than his other films. It builds up to violent situations and, by drawing parallels to "The Brothers Karamazov" and "Raavana," is filled with motifs that demand active engagement from the audience.

A.R. Rahman did an amazing job with the soundtrack. The songs "Adangaatha Asuran" and "Oh Raaya" serve as pillars for the anger and hurt emotions portrayed in the film. Both songs, penned by Dhanush (not Poet Dhanush), turn into war anthems and help us connect with Kathavaraayan, the protagonist.
