The film excels in its narrative structure, with financial fraud serving as a compelling plot device. Dulquer slides perfectly into this role, further cementing his position as the go-to actor for period films requiring charm and sophistication. 

The financial crime aspects are meticulously detailed and well-paced. The technical elements shine through, with stunning background scoring and cinematography enhancing the period setting. However, the character's transformation after acquiring wealth lacks sufficient development.
