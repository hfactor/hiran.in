A decent real-life story that maintains its authenticity without resorting to dramatic excess or larger-than-life heroics. While familiar military drama tropes appear occasionally, they don't overshadow the film.

Sai Pallavi's performance embodies striking contrasts throughout the film. Her portrayal in the climactic sequences demonstrates remarkable emotional depth, however in the early portions her dialogue delivery feels artificial, and her attempt to portray innocence comes across as overdone.

I found the malayali family sequences, including scenes featuring Syama Parasad, lacking emotional texture. However, the protagonist's family scenes provide a refreshing counterpoint, bringing genuine warmth and relatability to the story. 

CH Sai's cinematography shows remarkable maturity for a debut filmmaker, and is complemented perfectly by GV's background score.
