என்ன சார் இது!. 

"Indian" (1996) is the perfect blend of a Shankar-Kamal Hassan collaboration. It's a step up from Shankar's "Gentleman," with a larger canvas for storytelling. It also taps into all of Kamal's favorite themes—inner conflicts, rationality, and his favourite Nallavan-Kettan—while offering him a unique role as an 80-year-old grandfather, something rare for a Tamil hero. 

For Shankar, his Anti-Corruption Universe has spanned 30 years, starting with "Gentleman," followed by "Indian," "Mudhalvan," "Anniyan," and "Sivaji." These films have been massive, convincing, and engaging. But what compelled him to create a sequel to "Indian" with a 110+ year-old hero (instead of opting for a spin-off) is a question he should ask himself.

The issue lies in the lack of story, weak storytelling, and a lack of conviction. The film fails to connect with the audience—Siddharth's character doesn’t resonate with anyone in society and becomes more of a caricature. The "social issues" are presented through long visuals and monologues, making the movie drag and ultimately feel boring. It ends on a dull note, making "Indian 3" neither worth the wait nor the watch.
