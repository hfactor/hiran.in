 film suffers from an identity crisis - oscillating between a Rajnikanth spectacle and a Gnanavel social commentary, never quite finding its footing in either realm.

As a Rajnikanth vehicle, it delivers his signature moments of grandeur and style - scenes that only the Superstar can pull off without appearing excessive. Yet, the pacing feels oddly restrained, never quite achieving the larger-than-life heroism his fans expect. The much-anticipated Amitabh-Rajni pairing falls short of its potential, missing opportunities for more compelling dramatic sequences. However, the Fahadh-Rajni dynamic proves refreshing, reminiscent of the Vivek-Rajni chemistry in Sivaji, where both actors stand as equals.

Viewed through the lens of the 'Jai Bhim' director's filmography, the narrative feels cluttered with forced commercial elements. The social commentary and mass entertainment elements remain largely disconnected, linked only by the brutal ordeal faced by Dushara Vijayan's character. The director's apparent lack of confidence in this connecting thread manifests in repetitive flashbacks to the violence, as if trying to reinforce its significance.

While Gnanavel attempts to explore prejudice and systemic issues the core social context gets overshadowed by the dual focus on commercial elements and the connecting subplot. The film's epilogue feels unconvincing failing to deliver the impact it aims for.
